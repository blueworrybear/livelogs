# Live Logs to Go

Livelogs is a library to stream logs to multiple watchers.

The logs could also be save into database with [gorm](https://github.com/jinzhu/gorm).

# Example

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"time"

	"github.com/blueworrybear/livelogs"
	"github.com/blueworrybear/livelogs/core"
	"github.com/jinzhu/gorm"
	_ "github.com/jinzhu/gorm/dialects/sqlite"
)

func main() {
	db, _ := gorm.Open("sqlite3", "core.db")
	ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(context.Background())
	defer cancel()
	m := livelogs.NewLogManager(db)
	log, _ := m.Create()

	go func() {
		tail, _ := log.Tail(ctx)
		for {
			select {
			case line := <-tail:
				fmt.Println(line.Text)
			}
		}
	}()

	for {
		log.Write(ctx, &core.LogLine{Text: "log"})
		time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
	}
}
```

Above code will keep print out `log`.
